1. Exploratory data analysis on insurance data set 

I first loaded the necessary tools used in the anaysis followed by loading in the insurance dataset. The data consisted of 1338 rows and 7 columns

To get a visual representation of the numerical data, I created a histogram of the columns by using hist() from matplotlib. BMI has a gaussian distribution while charges is positively skewed, where most charges are aorund the 0â€“15000 range. It can ben see that there is relatively almost same number of female and male customers, with not a significant difference between number of customers per region. It is also obvious that most of the customers are non-smokers and there were only few who have more than 3 children.


2. MAE, RMSE, and MSE.
